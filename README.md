# Sentiment analysis
Implementation and comparison of several NLP techniques (Smoothed and Unsmoothed Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Doc2vec) to sentiment analysis of movie reviews (from the IMDB database).
This was done in the context of the University of Cambridge's MPhil in Machine Learning and Machine Intelligence ( https://www.mlmi.eng.cam.ac.uk/ ); some initial code was provided by the teaching staff.
Additional explanations can be found in "sentiment_analysis_report.pdf".
